# Solving-QUBOs-on-Quantum-Computers
This repository contains commented Jupyter Notebooks and Python files that accompany the paper "Five Starter Problems: Solving Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization models on Quantum Computers", by Arul Rhik Mazumder and Sridhar Tayur.

## Google Colabs
The programs were initially created and run on Google Colab, however, they can be reviewed using Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook. 
Each Colab file will provide a list of packages at the top and a commented description and implementation of each algorithm applied to various problems.
These programs were created and last run on December 18th, 2023. If the code no longer works due to a package update or moved database endpoint, please email arulm@andrew.cmu.edu.
